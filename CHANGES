Revision history for Perl extension POE::Component::Server::SOAP.

1.01  Mon Apr 26 17:30:18 2004
	- Broke tons of stuff :)
	- Took over ownership from Rocco Caputo

1.02  Thu Apr 28 12:01:25 2004
	- POD Formatting ( I'm still not an expert )
	- I forgot to add the test to the MANIFEST, so the distribution had no tests... *gah*

1.03  Mon May 03 16:50:38 2004
	- I realized that I didn't like having the SOAP Fault event called "ERROR" and changed it to "FAULT" :)
	- Fixed the Fault Code in the SYNOPSIS from Add:Error to the more SOAPy one
	- Rocco Caputo helped me with some POD errors/typos/stuff
	- Fixed new() to remove options that exist, but is undef -> results in croaking when DEBUG is on
