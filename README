--------
Abstract
--------

POE::Component::Server::SOAP adds asynchronous, event driven SOAP over
HTTP to your POE applications.  It works very well with synchronous
SOAP::Lite clients, even.

------------
Requirements
------------

POE::Component::Server::SOAP requires the following modules, each of
which probably has its own requirements.

  POE::Component::Server::HTTP
  SOAP::EnvelopeMaker

It is recommended to use some installation utility such as CPANPLUS,
CPAN, or ActiveState's PPM to ensure that dependencies are included.

------------------
Basic Installation
------------------

POE::Component::Server::SOAP may be installed through the CPAN shell
in the usual CPAN shell manner.  This typically is:

  $ perl -MCPAN -e 'intstall POE::Component::Server::SOAP'

You can also read this README from the CPAN shell:

  $ perl -MCPAN -e shell
  cpan> readme POE::Component::Server::SOAP

And you can install the component from the CPAN prompt as well:

  cpan> install POE::Component::Server::SOAP

-------------------
Manual Installation
-------------------

This component may also be installed manually.
<ftp://ftp.cpan.org/pub/CPAN/authors/id/R/RC/RCAPUTO/> or a similarly
named directory at your favorite CPAN mirror should hold the latest
version.

Downloading and unpacking the distribution are left as exercises for
the reader.  To build and test it:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make test

When you're ready to install the component:

  make install

Now it should be ready to use.

Thanks for reading!
